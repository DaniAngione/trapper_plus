# Trapper+
### by Daniel Angione
v2.2.2 for Stonehearth 1.1+
Compatible with Stonehearth ACE 0.9.6.18+

## DESCRIPTION

Trapper+ is the first in a series of mods that aim to improve the depth and gameplay of each profession in Stonehearth by enriching their crafting processes and giving them more complexity with features akin to a somewhat more realistic experience.

For this mod the leather making process is now broken into different stages - some requiring crafting and others requiring time. In the end, to compensate for the added complexity, the ratio of furs-to-leather is increased, which means that you'll produce more leather from less pelts now. But the production will require you to go through over the new steps which are basically the following:

> Drying - Cleaning - Tanning

Added to that, the Trapper can now perform some butchery actions like slicing larger chunks of meat into smaller ones, building a smokehouse that can be used to produce jerky and other smoked goods and also craft some decorations like animal rugs.

From 1.2 onwards, the Trapper can now work with other forms of curing like salting, boiling of animal fat, smoking salted meats and other interesting options.

## CONTENTS

### ANIMAL RESOURCES
Animals will now drop raw meat instead of edible jerky and fresh pelts instead of regular fur pelts. The meat can be used in cooking or smoked in a smokehouse while the pelts need drying on a drying rack if it is a large pelt (Boars, deer, wolves, cougars, foxes) or on a hanging drying rack for small pelts (Rabbits, raccoons, squirrels)
Animals will also drop Animal Fat, a new resource that can be used to create some new things or be used in cooking.

### THE TRAPPER
The trapper itself is now a crafting job with its own crafting station and crafting window. There the trapper can handle the cleaning of pelts, building of drying racks and tanning tubs, smokehouses, some decorations and also several butchering commands. Added to that, the Trapper can now create hats that will slightly improve their work abilities using the pelts of animals they hunt.

### DRYING & CLEANING
Fresh pelts dropped from dead animals require drying. Drying them only requires them to be stored inside a drying rack or a hanging drying rack (depending on pelt size) for a time and then it will be automatically dried. Workers and any other hearthlings with hauling capacities will help handle the tannery facilities to ease the trapper's workload, however after the pelts are dried they will require cleaning before being tanned, and that can only be done by the Trapper through their crafting menu.
	
### TANNINS & TANNING TUBS
When a pelt is cleaned it will become Rawhide, which will then be automatically carried by haulers into Tanning Tubs. A Tanning Tub is built with wood and tannins that can be obtained by extracting tannins from wood itself (or other organic sources like tree saplings). Both carpenters and potters can extract tannins from oaks and acacias but the trapper itself can do it more efficiently. After spending some time inside the tanning tubs, Rawhides will become Thin Leather - which can be used as leather or woven into bolts.
	
### BUTCHERY & SMOKERY
Every animal drops raw meat now and it can be used in cooking. To obtain jerky, raw meat needs to be smoked inside a smokehouse and any type of meat can be smoked. Certain larger pieces of meat like Pork or Mutton can be sliced into several bits of raw meat for more efficient usage should you care more about quantity than quality. All the butchering jobs are handled by the trapper.

### SALT & SALT CURING
You may now find veins of salt on the mountains and hills of your map and mine them for valuable rock salt. This can be further refined by a cook to create Sacks of Salt which can then be used by the Trapper to create Salt Boxes, containers that will salt goods similarly to how the smokeries smoke them. Once salted, meat can be already eaten - however it can be further cured in a smokehouse to achieve the best type of curing possible: jerky and cured goods.

### BOILING & COOKING
Finally, the Trapper can now create a nice and cosy campfire with a pot for improved possibilities. Options like a bug soup or the very useful Pemmican are made possible by this new tool which also allows the Trapper to refine certain resources like Animal Fat or boil leather.

## REQUIREMENTS & PATCHES

Trapper+ requires the following mods:

	Dani's Core Mod
	https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1403214892
	
Trapper+ has cross-functionality with the following mods:

- Stonehearth ACE : New recipes are available if ACE is present (related to ACE's resources, pelts and meats); All the visuals for fresh pelts, hats and carpets are changed according to the biome just like ACE's animals. There are also some new functionalities like Smokeries and Tanning Tubs requiring refueling every now and then; you can craft Fur piles that will keep track of the furs inside; Specific filters are included.

## COMPATIBILITY

This mod should always be compatible with most mods as long as they do not override basic functions of the game or the Trapper class controller.

## LOCALIZATION

This mod is completely compatible with Stonehearth's localization, it is in English (en) by default but also includes a Brazillian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation.

## CHANGELOG

### June 18th, 2025 - v2.2.2
- (ACE) Fixed an issue where the Clay or Stone Smokeries would turn into the Wooden one when running out of fuel.
- Fixed an issue with the Thin Leather Stockpile not working properly nor setting its filters automatically when used with ACE.
- The Cook can now craft Rendered Animal Fat, Tallow and Lard more efficiently than the Trapper can.
- (ACE) The Shepherd can now craft Rendered Tallow, Lard and Lanolin Wax. They're less efficient than both the Cook or Trapper for rendering fat but is more efficient in making the wax.

### May 11th, 2025 - v2.2.1
- (ACE) Fixed a crash when the Tanning Tub runs out of tannin.
- Adjusted the position of the Salt Box to perfectly fit a 2x3 space. You'll need new Salt Boxes, existing ones will look wonky. (This is a missing note from the previous update)
- Fixed an issue where Zillas could still drop vanilla Stonehearth Jerky.

### May 11th, 2025 - v2.2
- Added a "Weak" variant of the Snake Venom for the naturally spawned (not invasions) snakes. It should be less aggressive and easier to deal with when compared to the regular Snake Venom.
- Fixed a typo on the Snake Venom description.
- Also made it so naturally spawned snakes are slightly rarer, and have a lower chance of injecting venom.
- Added a previously announced but missing recipe for butchering a piece of Pork into the recently added Raw Bacon (x2).
- Fixed a serious issue where a lot of transformations were not being properly triggered or completely impossible due to the items not being stored at all, even with the correct filters selected. Several items were affected by this like Sausages, Venison, Pork, and also some modded items like Fish Meat or Duck Meat from ACE.
- Also fixed an issue where some of these items were transforming into the wrong item, most notably the salted venison that was turning into cured pork.
- Finally, also fixed an issue that made it so certain workbenches like drying frames or tanning tubs were impossible to be undeployed and stored.
- Unfortunately many of the fixes above will require new entities to be applied, so they will not correctly work for previously placed workbenches or previously harvested/butchered meat. It doesn't require a new game, however - exchanging all the Trapper's tools and waiting for new meat should fix everything over time.
- Fixed an old issue that made the items disappear when the salt expired on Salt Boxes (or when adding new salt) or Tanning Tubs ran out of tannin.
- Salt on Salt Boxes and fuel on Smokeries should now last a lot longer than before. The idea is to, eventually, convert some tools like Tanning Tubs and Salt Boxes to use a different regime where their "change" into a lesser form is not based on time but rather on how many items the processor has transformed. This will require further changes to Dani's Core Mod but should be a nice thing for the future. For now, enjoy longer-lasting fuel and salt!
- (ACE) Added the missing "Salted Duck" filter to Smokeries.
- (ACE) Fixed an issue where the Saltbush crop displayed a "0 Hours" growth time and never really achieved the harvestable stage.
- (ACE) Fixed an issue that allowed some meat types that shouldn't be available to be sold by Pasture merchants.

### March 9th, 2025 - v2.1
- Added 'Sun-drying Beam', workbench. The Trapper can now dry meat under the sun with some salt to create sun-dried goods. Sun-dried meats have a decent buff and more servings, overall they're not as good as Cured (Salted + Smoked) goods, but they're better than either smoking or salting individually.
- Added 'Sun-tanning Rack', workbench. This new facility is very versatile, being able to both dry fresh pelts and skins or tan rawhide into leather. However, it is only really good at drying skins, which it can do faster than a drying frame and without quality loss. Pelts and leather are both slower than their other methods, and will have a small quality reduction.
- (ACE) Both of the workbenches above need their salt replenished after some days of use.
- (ACE) Improved the existing storage filter presets, and added a new one for Supply containers, 'Tannery Supplies'.
- The Brazillian Portuguese (PT-BR) translation has bee updated and now includes all of the content! Viva!
- Changed the Tanning Tub's debuff to be a lot less punishing. It will now last a lot less, only being an issue for those that are constantly near the vats.
- Changed and streamlined some inner workings of the mod, mostly some material tags and definitions that were very specific and are now more generic, being reusable by other features.
- Salt Boxes are now slightly slower than before.
- (ACE) Smoked dry fruits (Walnuts, chestnuts, etc.) should now have the same amount of servings as their raw counterpart in ACE.
- Fixed an issue that prevented some fish goods from being ever eaten (servings were impossible to obtain due to an issue with the `stacks` component)
- Fixed some minor visual artifacts and misaligned models (Drying Frames, Cured Steak, etc.)
- Fixed some wrong filters and filter presets, like venison being included in the white meat filters.
- Fixed some issues with meats not providing the correct buffs for the person that eats them; In particular, all Game Meat was giving the Red Meat buff instead of the Game Meat buff, among others.
- Fixed some missing or broken localization strings, like the Oinker Skin description or the names of filter presets.
- Fixed an issue where facilities that should prevent the decay of raw meats (like Smokehouses) were not preventing anything, actually, which allowed meats to spoil before they turned.
- Fixed some minor typos here and there.

### November 16th, 2024 - v2.0.3
- (ACE and/or Archipelago Biome) Fixed fish meats not being properly stored in smokehouses or salt boxes.
- Fixed bounding boxes of drying racks and tanning tubs while using the builder
- Fixed several missing text strings, lots of missing or wrong item names and some typos.
- (ACE) Removed the repeated rendered fat filters from the Refrigerator filters.

### November 4th, 2024 - v2.0.2
- Added salt to food merchants.
- Fixed some extra instances of vanilla jerky being dropped (Goblins, Loot Chests)
- Fixed (properly) the missing ingredient for the "Slice Fish" recipe
- Fixed some missing resource icons or localizations on different storage filters
- Fixed some localization issues
- (ACE) Smoked, Salted and Cured meats will now count as "Food (Prepared)"
- (ACE) Added some filter presets for Smokeries, Smoking Pits and Salt Boxes

### November 1st, 2024 - v2.0.1
- Fixed issue with broken "Any Thin Leather" resource on recipes.
- Changed some recipes that previously specifically required Thin Leather to accept any Thin Leather.
- Improved the icons for some leather resources on recipes.
- Added support to the initial loadouts for "Firefly Clan" and "Church of Plenty"; They will no longer contain Jerky.
- Fixed an issue that could be triggered when starting a game with Jerky.
- Changed the regular bolt of leather to require non-scaly thin leather instead of any thin leather.

### October 31st, 2024 - v2.0
#### KNOWN ISSUES
- PT-BR translation is currently outdated and will remain so until some other features are updated. Sorry about that!
- A couple of previously teased/mentioned features were proving to be difficult and didn't make the cut. They'll be here on an upcoming update: Sundrying, Drying Beams, Drying Racks.

#### CHANGES
- This is a huge update for the mod, so we're calling it version 2.0! Many of the changes are unlisted here due to simply getting lost across complete reworks; The major points, however, are listed below.
- The mod now utilizes the reworked and much more advanced/flexible "PASSIVE TRANSFORMER" component from Dani's Core Mod.
- Added Snakes! This new creature will show up as a trappable animal but also as a possible foe from the "Forest" faction. Snakes have an unique poison effect that require special treatment provided by the Herbalist...
- (ACE) The Trapper can also create a new Tonic called Snake Juice to prevent infections.
- Snakes have their own pelt and meat (white, small).
- Added Saltbush, a new type of shrub that can be harvested for fiber. Saltbush bundles can also be dried on a small drying rack (Crafted by the Trapper) and then used in a special crafting recipe to obtain salt.
- (ACE) Saltbush can be learned as a farming crop when using ACE.
- All raw meats have been remade and follow a new, more streamlined structure. There are now 4 types of raw meat: Red, White, Game and Fish (if using ACE and/or Archipelago Biome). Each meat type has associated buffs and unique appearance. Additionally, raw meats will now display the animal they come from on their icons.
- The buffs mentioned above will also combine with the 3 different buffs from the ways meat can be preserved/processed: Smoked, Salted or Cured (which is Salted + Smoked, in that order). Cured meat pieces will become Jerky.
- Added Smoking Pit, a very simple new structure used to smoke raw meats. Will reduce the quality of items it preserves.
- Added Simple Smokery, a new structure that can be used to smoke your raw and salted goods on the mid-game.
- The Smokehouse will now increase the quality of items it preserves.
- The visuals of Smokehouses has been reworked and they look much nicer now!
- The visuals of many other items/facilities has been tweaked/polished.
- Smokehouses will now use the new "ENTITY CUTAWAY" component from Dani's Core Mod, allowing you to peek into their contents when selected.
- Added Bacon! Bacon is a (very delicious!) food that is made by smoking Raw Bacon. Raw Bacon can be obtained by the Trapper as a second choice of butchering for Raw Pork. It might also sometimes drop from Boars. Unlike other meats, bacon does not need to be salted and will be smoked straight into "Cured" form, its best possible state.
- (ACE) Raw Bacon will also more commonly drop from Oinkers!
- Trappers will verify their trapping grounds less often, however they can now place up to 6 traps per field (and the traps can be closer to each other); This should give them some extra crafting time without compromising their efficiency.
- Removed the "Tannery" trait from Trappers (it wasn't really needed for anything)
- Filters for the smokehouse and salt box have been adjusted.
- The fish trap recipe has been removed from the Carpenter.
- The "Pemmican" recipe now produces 6 items instead of 3.
- Sausage recipes have been similarly buffed, producing more than before.
- Sausages now require a cut of animal fat.
- The "Trapper's Campfire & Pot" recipe now requires an ingot of Iron.
- (ACE) This requirement is "any hard metal" when using ACE.
- Removed the filters for fresh pelts in priority storage (these were preventing the drying racks from being used). The filters are still present with ACE since it allows different priority on different storage.
- The "Trapper's Campfire & Pot" will no longer have fire and light when in ghost form (still unplaced)
- The "Tanning Tub" will no longer have its fumes when in ghost form (still unplaced)
- The "Fresh Leather Stockpile" has been renamed "Thin Leather Stockpile" to avoid confusion with all the other "Fresh" stuff like pelts.
- Carpets have been slightly lowered into the ground so they look thinner.
- Merchants have been updated to offer the new meats from Trapper+
- (ACE) This includes the ACE Pasture and Hunting merchants.
- (ACE) Added support for ACE's ducks.
- (ACE) Added support for Oinker's pelt. They will work as rawhide straight away when dried, not needing to be cleaned!
- (ACE) The Trapper's crafting UI has been updated to work with the new ACE update.
- (ACE) Added "Bar of Soap", a new healing item for infections of any severity and cuts and pierce wounds of low severity. Made by the Trapper using rendered fat, charcoal and clay.
- (ACE) "Slice" recipes will be ignored by the ACE Smart Crafter.
- (ACE) Specific filters for ACE (and removal of "single item restrictions") for all drying racks.
- (ACE) Adjusted the Supply containers filters to not include general categories anymore since ACE allows multiple selections.
- (ACE) Priority has been adjusted for all the containers.
- The Warm-Wolf recipe will produce two units instead of one.
- (ACE) Warm-Wolf will now be crafted on a Cook's Table if using ACE.
- (ACE) Fixed lots of recipes that were broken because of resource changes and also added some Trapper+ stuff to some of the new ACE recipes.
- (ACE) Fuel has been removed from all recipes that previously used fuel.
- (ACE) There's now "Trapper" support for the "Finished Work Shelf" output containers.
- (ACE) The Trapper can split firewood now.

### February 6th, 2020 - v1.2.2
- Added a new boiled leather craftable item: Boiled Leather Worker's Backpack! This item will only be present if using ACE.
- Added new and improved filters for certain containers. Input bins (Supply baskets, supply tables, etc...) can now hold Clumps o' Rock Salt, Salt, Smoked Salt (and not just any salt), Cuts of Animal Fat and Any Rendered Animal Fat or the specific types.
- If using ACE, you'll now be able to put the different kinds of rendered animal fat, salt and rock salt in barrels or supply casks. Additionally, output tuns will accept salt as a dry good and rendered fats as other fluids.
- The transformation times of all items in the mod have been tweaked slightly. Should now be a bit more challenging in the early game and you probably won't drown on pelts and jerky by the end game. This change only affects the transformation time and not the dropping rates - which means you can achieve the same production if you just increase the amount of transformation tools (drying racks, smokehouses, salt boxes, etc.)
- Really fixed (this time for real!) a bug that caused the Fish Trap limit to reset. (Only for ACE users)
- Fixed an issue that didn't allow the player to craft the Rayya's Children exclusive cooking recipe "Meat Tagine".
- Trapper+ is now officially compatible with the "Home Sweet Home" mod and it is now possible to craft its "Ingredients Pantry" item using Trapper+'s meat.
- Trapper+ is also now compatible with lots of biome mods so that they can display the proper colors for salt nodes. These are: Canyon (already worked by default), Archipelago, Lorki's Biome, Plains, Meadow, Midgard Forest, Taiga (both versions), Rocky Mountains, Sacred Grove, Savannah, Seasonal Forest, Swamp, The Coast, Pale Peaks, Silent Woods and White Cliffs.

### January 22th, 2020 - v1.2.1
- There is now an Input Bin filter for Pinch of Tannin.
- Out of fuel smokehouses, watered tanning tubs and dirty salt boxes can all now be fixed by workers as well. This was changed mostly because the Trapper is already quite busy as it is and there were cases where they could take a couple of days before having time to do such things. This change only affects your game if you also use ACE.
- The Fish Trap Limit issue has been fixed and the trapper can now once again unlock fish trap slots for your town.
- A bug that caused ACE fish fillets to be smoked directly into jerky has been fixed.
- A game impairing bug that prevented raw meat from being recognized and usable by cooks has also been fixed.
- A very weird bug that caused all the biome-unique visuals for Trapper+ Hats and Rugs when using ACE to not be changed correctly if NOT using Archipelago Biome mod has been fixed.

### January 19th, 2020 - v1.2
- The mod structure has been completely re-organized to mirror the Stonehearth mod structure. It should be much easier to explore (and learn) from Trapper+ now!
- All recipes that replaced existing recipes are now mixins rather than overrides.
- All the images and icons in the mod now have the same contour for a nicer, standard visual.
- Many of the recipes have had their level requirements re-organized or moved around a bit.
- The mixintos into the biome manifests have been replaced by new biome manifests.
- Campfire & Pot! This new work station for the Trapper allows them to boil, render and cook. This work station is useful for several of the new recipes and processes and some upcoming ones!
- Cut of Animal Fat, a new resource obtained when butchering dead creatures.
- You can also obtain Animal Fat with crafting, from large meat pieces.
- Bucket of Rendered Animal Fat, a new cooking ingredient obtained by rendering animal fat with the Campfire & Pot.
- Slab of Lard, alternative rendered animal fat made with pork.
- Changed the images for the Rawhide, Rawskin and Small Rawhide to look nicer and more standarized.
- Changed the model of the Drying Frame. It now uses animations to have sleek, straight legs instead of ugly and crispy voxel-diagonals!
- Drying Frames now have a default filter (Fresh Pelt) and don't need to be set up anymore. 
- The same applies for Drying Racks, the one used for small pelts.
- Slightly changed the models of the Smokeries and also changed their names to Wooden Smokery and Clay Smokery.
- Multiple new storage options have been added. Although specialized in single items, they have a larger capacity than common input bins.
- Large Pelt Stockpile, input container. Use it to pile up to 20 large dried pelts.
- Small Pelt Wall Rack, input container. Use it to hang up to 20 small dried pelts.
- Rawhide Stockpile, output container. Use it to storage your Rawhide before it goes to tanning tubs.
- Fresh Leather Stockpile, input container. Use it to pile up to 20 thin leather.
- Added a new Smokery, the Stone Smokery.
- Smoking pieces of raw meat will not result in jerky anymore, only in smoked meat.
- To get jerky now the meat requires to be salted before it is smoked.
- Jerky doesn't count as "raw meat" anymore and is its own prepared food. Its efficiency and quality have been increased a lot to compensate for the effort of making it.
- Each smokery is now exclusive to their related faction; Wood for Ascendancy, Stone for Northern Alliance and Clay for Rayya's Children.
- Smokeries now have a stronger inner light, giving them a cooler effect when the doors are open!
- Smokeries now have a default filter (All Curables). You can still change the filter by clicking them.
- Fixed the broken positioning of the Tanning Tub smog effect.
- Fixed lots of typos throughout the whole mod.
- All instances of "Cougar" were renamed to "Big Cat".
- Wolf Rug and Big Cat Rug have been enlarged and are now 4x4 instead of 3x3.
- Pinch of Tannin is now slightly smaller.
- Tanning tubs now have a "Foul Smog" buff that will inflict nearby hearthlings with the "Foul Stench" debuff if they stay around for too long. The debuff reduces some stats and makes them sad. Build your tanneries far away from town!
- Tanning Tubs now have a default filter (Rawhide & Raw Skin). You don't need to set them up anymore!
- The graphics and styles of all raw meat cuts has been changed. They now look more like generic meat bits instead of different colored jerkies.
- Slicing Varanus meat now requires a Trapper of level 2 and not level 3.
- Bug Meat Soup, a simpler version of the stew - without veggies but craftable by the Trapper. Should help out factions that start with trappers and bug catching zones but have no cooks!
- Pemmican, a somewhat efficient (but not tasty) food that the Trapper can craft on level 6 using meat, fruits, fat and rawhide.
- Pelts have been organized better and their graphics are now properly rendered, with no more generic pelt graphics overlapping them because of the mixin.
- Additionally, pelts are now properly categorized as small, large or skins (varanus, etc.) and while some recipes accept any pelt or any skin, certain recipes will require specific pelt sizes.
- The same applies for meat, which is now divided as small and large raw meat. Most recipes will accept any meat but - again - some might require specific sizes.
- The Trapper lua is not an override anymore (Yay!) but rather a nice and clean monkey-patch! This should make the mod compatible with other mods that modify the trapper, like ACE.
- You can now choose individual resource types for many of the trapper tools, similarly to how you can choose specific foods for the Smokery. For example, you can set up drying racks to only accept specific pelts or tanning tubs to only accept either Rawhide or Raw Skin.
- A new type of vein will now generate on all biomes, called Salt Vein. Salt Veins can be mined for Clumps 'o Rock Salt, which can then be refined by a level 1 Cook and turned into Sacks of Salt.
- Salt can be used as a seasoning but also for preserving and curing meats.
- Salt can also be bought from new traders, Salt Mine Merchants.
- Boiled Leather, a new resource - and Boiled Leather stuff like a small and normal chest, an input box and a new set of armor. Made from bolts of leather and any wax.
- Waxes can now be crafted by the Herbalist from certain plants or by the Trapper from wool.
- Salt Box, container. Use it for salting your curables, similarly to how smokehouses work but with longer lasting results. Salted goods can then be smoked, creating even better products.
- Fixed an issue that made it so pets would get into a weird loop trying to eat raw meat and would end up starving to death without ever eating.
- All Building Templates have been tweaked and now contain the new campfire & pot and storage options.
- Additionally, there is now a new building template for "Curing Yards" that contain smokeries and salt boxes.
- Due to Jerky now being a quite good food item, all loadouts that contained jerky have had it replaced for regular smoked meat.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the Trapper from obtaining experience by trapping - it was only gaining experience from crafting.
ACE Compatibility:
- Resources for all ACE creatures and new foods have been added, which include fresh hides and raw meat for Moo-moos, Bears... etc.
- If ACE is active, the Northern Alliance and Rayya's Children Trappers will have a recipe for fox hats instead of raccoon hats. They're basically the same stat-wise, but since the ACE NA trapper already has a Raccoon hat, this solves that issue.
- Additionally, all the pelts, and hats have unique graphics for each biome, based on the unique graphics of their animals on each biome as well.
- Rendered Animal Fat can be used as a grease in cooking.
- Lard can be used as "Any Butter".
- Bucket of Tallow, alternative animal fat rendered from steak. Can be used as grease, cooking oil or poor wax.
- Beeswax will now be obtained when harvesting bee nests or skeps.
- There is a recipe for slicing Steak, it provides two pieces of raw meat.
- There is a couple of new recipes for fur bundles, large (48) and small (6). Fur bundles are like other piles, but they're restricted to ACE to benefit from the ACE Pile component that allows a crafted pile to remember the individual items used to make it, so you can get exactly the same pelts back.
- Bug Meat Soup provides the "Warm Belly" buff.
- Pemmican can be crafted with the "Fruit" resource instead of "Fruit Seed"
- The Trapper can craft Fish Traps, and the Carpenter can't anymore.
- There is a more efficient tannin recipe that requires Chestnut logs. It produces two pinches of tannin but requires the trapper's campfire & pot.
- When using ACE, there is now a new mechanic that will cause Tanning Tubs to run out of Tannin, Salt Boxes get brined and Smokehouses run out of fuel. The trapper will automatically refill these resources but it will require you to maintain them (like tannins or salt)
- All the best cured products provide a buff (Smoky Flavors) when eaten if using ACE.
- Whenever ACE is active, the "Harvest Beast Loot Table" data is removed from animals since ACE doesn't use it either.
- The mod is also completely compatible with the Archipelago Biome mod, having special products related with the Archipelago fishes and specific filters for them.
- There is also a recipe for slicing Big Fish into fish fillets if both ACE and the Archipelago mod are present.
- The mod is also compatible with LostEms, adapting the small fur rug recipe to use small pelts.

### August 23rd, 2018 - v1.1
- Updated the Trapper's LUA to Stonehearth's most recent version. (Oops!)
- Added a new craftable item for the Trapper: Fur Coat
Fur Coats can be worn by Workers and will work like a Winter Worker Outfit, removing the 
negative effects of cold weather. Unlike the Winter Worker Outfit, however, Fur Coats do 
not provide the Worker with the "Devoted" buff, being a cheaper solution for the cold.
- Made it so that carnivore animals can feed on raw meat.

### August 21st, 2018 - v1.0
- Initial release
