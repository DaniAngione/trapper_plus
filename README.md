## DESCRIPTION

Trapper+ is the first in a series of mods that aim to improve the depth and gameplay of each
profession in Stonehearth by enriching their crafting processes and giving them more
complexity with features akin to a somewhat more realistic experience.

For this mod the leather making process is now broken into different stages - some requiring
crafting and others requiring time. In the end, to compensate for the added complexity, the 
ratio of furs-to-leather is increased, which means that you'll produce more leather from 
less pelts now. But the production will require you to go through over the new steps which
are basically the following:

> Drying
> Cleaning 
> Tanning 

Added to that, the Trapper can now perform some butchery actions like slicing larger chunks
of meat into smaller ones, building a smokehouse that can be used to produce jerky and other 
smoked goods and also craft some decorations like animal rugs.

## CONTENTS

# ANIMAL RESOURCES
Animals will now drop raw meat instead of edible jerky and fresh pelts instead of regular
fur pelts. The meat can be used in cooking or smoked in a smokehouse while the pelts need
drying on a drying rack if it is a large pelt (Boars, deer, wolves, cougars, foxes) or on 
a hanging drying rack for small pelts (Rabbits, raccoons, squirrels)

# THE TRAPPER
The trapper itself is now a crafting job with its own crafting station and crafting window.
There the trapper can handle the cleaning of pelts, building of drying racks and tanning
tubs, smokehouses, some decorations and also several butchering commands.
Added to that, the Trapper can now create hats that will slightly improve their work 
abilities using the pelts of animals they hunt.

# DRYING & CLEANING
Fresh pelts dropped from dead animals require drying. Drying them only requires them to 
be stored inside a drying rack or a hanging drying rack (depending on pelt size) for a 
time and then it will be automatically dried. Workers and any other hearthlings with 
hauling capacities will help handle the tannery facilities to ease the trapper's workload,
however after the pelts are dried they will require cleaning before being tanned, and that 
can only be done by the Trapper through their crafting menu.
	
# TANNINS & TANNING TUBS
When a pelt is cleaned it will become Rawhide, which will then be automatically carried by 
haulers into Tanning Tubs. A Tanning Tub is built with wood and tannins that can be obtained
by extracting tannins from wood itself (or other organic sources like tree saplings). Both 
carpenters and potters can extract tannins from oaks and acacias but the trapper itself can 
do it more efficiently. After spending some time inside the tanning tubs, Rawhides will 
become Thin Leather - which can be used as leather or woven into bolts.
	
# BUTCHERY & SMOKERY
Every animal drops raw meat now and it can be used in cooking. To obtain jerky, raw meat needs
to be smoked inside a smokehouse and any type of meat can be smoked. Certain larger pieces of 
meat like Pork or Mutton can be sliced into several bits of raw meat for more efficient usage
should you care more about quantity than quality. All the butchering jobs are handled by the
trapper.

## CHANGELOG

# (August 23rd, 2018) v1.1
- Updated the Trapper's LUA to Stonehearth's most recent version. (Oops!)
- Added a new craftable item for the Trapper: Fur Coat
Fur Coats can be worn by Workers and will work like a Winter Worker Outfit, removing the 
negative effects of cold weather. Unlike the Winter Worker Outfit, however, Fur Coats do 
not provide the Worker with the "Devoted" buff, being a cheaper solution for the cold.
- Made it so that carnivore animals can feed on raw meat.

# (August 21st, 2018) v1.0
- Initial release
